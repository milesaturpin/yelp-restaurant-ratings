# STAT199 Final Project â€” Yelp 

Final Project for STAT199: Intro to Data Science. We create a model to predict ratings for restaurants on Yelp based on their attributes e.g. noise level, alcohol, price range. 

NOTE: Do not run the `load-data.R` file as the original yelp dataset was proprietary and is not included. The files to be loaded in the `project.Rmd` file are already created.
